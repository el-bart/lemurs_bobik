# TODOs
* port electronics to full-smd.
* use MOSFET transistors.
* add circut that will start MCU only when button is pressend and so that MCU can hold on to that state and power itself off (eg. after program is done).
* add nut space on top of screw holes, so that it can be easily screws in.
* decrease gear down ratio - model moves way to slow now...
