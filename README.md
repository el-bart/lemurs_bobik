# Lemur's Bobik

project of a toy for a 3-5 year child, that is aimed at learning basic programming skills.
robot has 4 buttons for programming directions and one button to start it.

program is generated by a sequence of buttons pressed (eg. forward, forward, left).
after pressing "start" button, robot begins execution of a given sequence.
its programming is thus similar to Logo programming language, but does not require one to be able to read/write, or spending time in front of the screen.

robot's body is designed to mimic a bit autonomic vacuum cleaner robots, that children know and love. :)

part SMD, part THT... yes... i know... the thing started during COVID-19 lockdown in my country and the initial idea was to make it all with what i had at home at the moment.
have a look at `TODO.txt` file, that lists loads of things that shall be improved / changed.


## HW parts
* 2x unipolar stepper motors
* 4x M3x10 screws
* 4x M3 threaded inserts

TODO: wrap up the list
