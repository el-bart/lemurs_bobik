# TODOs
* port electronics to full-SMD.
* use MOSFET transistors.
* add circuit that will start MCU only when button is pressed and so that MCU can hold on to that state and power itself off (eg. after program is done).
* add program-reset button.
* put stronger stepper motors, and avoid need for a reduction. NEMA 17 motors (typical ones for 3D printers) seem perfect here!
* add some status LEDs on the top.
