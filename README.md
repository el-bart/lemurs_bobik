# Lemur's Bobik

project for a little toy for a child, that is aimed at learning basic programming skills.
robot has 4 buttons for programming directions and one button to start it.
it's programming is thus similar to Logo programming language, but does not require one to be able to read/write.

program is generated by a sequence of buttons pressed (eg. forward, forward, left).
after pressing "start" button, robot begins execution of a given sequence.

robot's body is designed to mimic a bit autonomic vacuum cleaner robots, that children know love. :)
